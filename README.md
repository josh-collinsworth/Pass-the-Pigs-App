A fairly simple (to use) app for scorekeeping with the dice game "Pass the Pigs." Note that this is just a scorekeeping app; you'll still need the actual dice to play the game.

I own absolutely no claim or copyright to Pass the Pigs. That's all Hasbro, Winning Moves and/or David Moffat Enterprises, as far as I know. I just made the app. Thus, I can't really license this, so just don't use this without giving credit, please.

Version 1.0.1: MVP build, plus fixed a lot of responsive CSS things so breakpoints line up and text and modals look better on smaller screens. Also, jpgs -> pngs (transparency!)

TODO: 

-Add error checking/sanitation and truncation to user input
-Fix the post-game re-win
-Fix single player 
-Maybe add an undo button
-Add ability to rename players
