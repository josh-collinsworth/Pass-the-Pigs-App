A fairly simple (to use) app for scorekeeping with the dice game "Pass the Pigs." Note that this is just a scorekeeping app; you'll still need the actual dice to play the game.

I own absolutely no claim or copyright to Pass the Pigs. That's all Hasbro, Winning Moves and/or David Moffat Enterprises, as far as I know. I just made the app. Thus, I can't really license this, so feel free to use this for fun, bu just don't use this without giving credit, please.

Version 1.4:
• Now you'll be warned before navigating away or refreshing the page so you don't accidentally erase all your hard-earned pig points (so you'll have more opportunities to do that on your own with bad rolls and questionable decisions).
• Fixed that weird error where the arrows went beyond the bottom of the page and caused scrolling. They're back in their pen now, and they'll stay there.

TODO: 

[ ] Add error checking/sanitation and truncation to user input
[ ] Fix the post-game re-win
[ ] Fix single player 
[ ] Maybe add an undo button
