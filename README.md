A fairly simple (to use) app for scorekeeping with the dice game "Pass the Pigs." Note that this is just a scorekeeping app; you'll still need the actual dice to play the game.

I own absolutely no claim or copyright to Pass the Pigs. That's all Hasbro, Winning Moves and/or David Moffat Enterprises, as far as I know. I just made the app. Thus, I can't really license this, so feel free to use this for fun, bu just don't use this without giving credit, please.

Version 1.3:
• NEW: you can now rename players by clicking on their name in the scoreboard! (Not the header, though, because that's a whole other buncha hogwash. Maybe someday.)
• Switched the arrows that highlight the selected pigs from CSS to JavaScript to enable some very neat and entirely unneccessary animation
• Yet further improved logging (more events trigger the log, so you can always trace exactly where your pig rolling decisions went horribly wrong)

TODO: 

[ ] Add error checking/sanitation and truncation to user input
[ ] Fix the post-game re-win
[ ] Fix single player 
[ ] Maybe add an undo button
[x] Add ability to rename players --Added in v 1.3!
